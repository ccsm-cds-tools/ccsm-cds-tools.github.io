00:00:00.899 --> 00:00:02.779
Awesome. Thank you, Gene, for teeing that up.


00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.220
Yeah,  and  as  Gene  said,  there's  multiple  ways  to  kind  of  integrate


00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.039
this  into  an  electronic  health  record,


00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.920
but  I'm  going  to  be  showing  our  clinical  dashboard,  which  is  what


00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.520
we're  currently  piloting  with  a  medical  center  right  now.


00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.559
So  what  I'm  showing  here  is  a  mock -up  of  what  you  can  imagine


00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.540
would  be  a  clinician's  view  of  their  electronic  health  record.


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.639
Of  course,  that  view  is  actually  going  to  change  depending  on,  you


00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:26.860
know,  what  health  center  you're  at,


00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.540
But  what  I  might  have  here  is  for  patients  who  I'm  going  to  be


00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.020
managing  this  week  as  a  clinician  and


00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:37.220
clicking  the  link  of  these  patients  name  will  allow  me  to  see  their


00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.000
cervical  cancer  screening  and  management


00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.380
recommendation.  So  I  just  clicked  on  this  patient  zone  here  and  what


00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.900
what's  happening  in  the  background  it  happened  kind  of  quickly


00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.439
but  is  that  the  EHR  or  electronic  health  record  is  reaching  out  to


00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.279
our  CDS  app  and  then  our  CDS  app  is


00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.580
asking  it  for  all  of  the  patient  data  that  it  might  need  to


00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.740
calculate  a  recommendation.


00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.639
Then  when  that  comes  back  to  our  app,  what  it's  doing  is  filtering


00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:02.759
that  down  to  really


00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.139
just  display  the  key  data  that  we  need  to  generate  that  risk  score


00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:08.239
that  Gene  had  mentioned,


00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.480
and that data we show on the left-hand side of the screen.


00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.080
So  the  key  components  are  the  screening  and  management  testing


00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.739
history  on  the  top  left,


00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:21.680
and  then  on  the  bottom  is  additional  relevant  medical  history  that


00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.220
can  kind  of  help  the


00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.680
to contextualize everything and might not be crucial


00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:29.199
to the risk-based algorithm,


00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.319
but helps the clinician kind of provide,


00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:34.400
see that whole patient's journey in context.


00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:37.959
So this patient is currently in management,


00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.540
whereas a normal patient who's screening


00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:43.279
for a 33-year-old, as this patient is,


00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.300
would usually come back every five years.


00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.959
You can see, based upon this patient's history,


00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.419
that they've actually been coming at more frequent intervals


00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.260
because they've had some abnormal results


00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.699
for both their HPV testing


00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:58.879
and their cervical cytology testing.


00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.559
And so how this actually works


00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.900
or what this is computing is that the most recent tests,


00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.059
so those top two rows combined


00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:09.199
with the previous testing history,


00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.559
kind of come together and get fed into this algorithm


00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.520
to generate a risk estimate,


00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.179
which is shown in this lookup table


00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:17.580
on the bottom right here.


00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.679
So this patient, because of all this history


00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:26.419
combined  together  has  an  immediate  pre -cancer  risk  of  just  over  1 %


00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.860
and  then  a  5 -year  pre -cancer


00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.300
risk of 4%.


00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.259
And  so  according  to  these  guidelines  that  we  have  printed  out  here,


00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:35.940
that  corresponds  with


00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.580
a one-year follow-up.


00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:42.119
So  again,  this  patient  has  had  some  abnormalities,  so  is  coming  back


00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.360
more  frequently  than  the


00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:48.960
normally  prescribed  5 -year  interval,  but  it  isn't  severe  enough  that


00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.800
their  risk  would


00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.919
warrant them getting an immediate intervention.


00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.660
Now, what I'm going to show next is,


00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.639
in working with our pilot partners,


00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.720
one source of feedback we've got is


00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.720
that there are some clinical data elements that just


00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.940
will not consistently be recorded in a structured format


00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.720
in the electronic health record.


00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.100
So this would be things like whether the patient's


00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.220
immunosuppressed, if they're pregnant,


00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.919
if they have future pregnancy concerns,


00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.020
or maybe they showed up to an encounter


00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.179
with an abnormal bleeding condition.


00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.300
And so for these cases, we've integrated these toggle switches


00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.539
to allow the clinician to say, hey,


00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.259
I want to refire this clinical decision support,


00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.039
show a new recommendation with the same history,


00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.320
but as if one of these data elements existed.


00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:37.960
So what I'm going to do in a moment


00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.639
is hit the immunosuppressed toggle switch,


00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.039
and you'll see what happens then is that that loading spinner


00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.100
will come up again.


00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.520
This will recalculate a recommendation,


00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.779
and that will be a new recommendation


00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.160
with that same patient history,


00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.080
but as if that patient was immunosuppressed.


00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.839
And so when that happens,


00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960
you'll see that this recommendation will actually change


00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.000
from a one-year follow-up to a colposcopy,


00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.479
because at that point, since the patient is immunosuppressed,


00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.319
that actually raises their risk level


00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.339
to a point that they now need that immediate intervention


00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.959
as opposed to just coming back a year later.


00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.739
And then kind of a final way we've,


00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.480
a final way you can interact with this dashboard


00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:31.000
is these add result and add additional resource buttons


00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.220
on the left side.


00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:34.679
So if there was something that you knew


00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:38.440
this patient had a test result or some sort of condition


00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.839
that wasn't necessarily represented in this history here


00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:44.940
because maybe it wasn't entered in a structured format


00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.239
or wasn't entered into the EHR at all,


00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:49.359
you could go in and add a result


00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.959
and then again, recalculate a recommendation


00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.859
like we did with the toggle switches.


00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.119
So that's kind of a general overview of what we've built.


00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:00.040
This is a tool that we're currently piloting


00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:02.279
with the University of Mississippi Medical Center.


00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.880
It's currently in production in their health system


00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:07.459
and this upcoming calendar year,


00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.159
we're looking forward to starting a clinical evaluation phase


00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.140
where we're going to see how this actually works in practice


00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.959
and affects the treatment of patients there.


00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.320
So that'll turn things back over to Gene.


00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.940
